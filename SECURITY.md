✅ Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificate
✅ Configure proper firewall rules
✅ Regular system updates and patches
✅ Monitor application logs
✅ Backup encryption keys securely
```

#### 🔧 Configuration Security
```python
# Security configuration in production
DEBUG = False
SECRET_KEY = 'random-strong-secret-key-here'
SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = False
UPLOAD_FOLDER = '/secure/upload/path'
MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH = 100 * 1024 * 1024  # 100MB limit
```

#### 🗃️ Database Security
```bash
# SQLite security best practices
✅ Database file permissions: 600 (owner read/write only)
✅ Regular database backups
✅ Backup encryption
✅ Database integrity checks
```
