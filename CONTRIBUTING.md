- Use **consistent naming** for CSS classes
- Optimize for **mobile-first** design

### Code Example

```python
def process_meeting_transcript(transcript_text: str) -> dict:
    """
    Process meeting transcript using AI to extract structured information.
    
    Args:
        transcript_text: Raw meeting transcript text
        
    Returns:
        dict: Structured meeting data containing summary, action_items, decisions
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If transcript_text is empty or too short
    """
    if not transcript_text or len(transcript_text.strip()) < 20:
        raise ValueError("Transcript text is too short")
    
    # Process the transcript
    result = {
        "summary": extract_summary(transcript_text),
        "action_items": extract_action_items(transcript_text),
        "decisions": extract_decisions(transcript_text)
    }
    
    return result
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_ai_processor.py
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for **all new features**
- Include **edge cases** and **error conditions**
- Use **descriptive test names**
- Follow **AAA pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert)

```python
def test_process_meeting_transcript_with_valid_input():
    """Test that valid transcript input returns expected structure."""
    # Arrange
    transcript = "Meeting started. John discussed project status..."
    
    # Act
    result = process_meeting_transcript(transcript)
    
    # Assert
    assert "summary" in result
    assert "action_items" in result
    assert "decisions" in result
    assert len(result["summary"]) > 0
```
